Now you have devonIde installed.

 1. Before proceeding with setup. Have a look at feature and characteristics of cobigen.

 2. Generate fresh files across all the layers of a application - ready to run.

3. Add on to existing files merging code into it. E.g. generate new methods into existing java classes or adding nodes to an XML file. Merging of contents into existing files will be done using structural merge mechanisms.

4. Structural merge mechanisms are currently implemented for Java, XML, Java Property Syntax, JSON, Basic HTML, Text Append, TypeScript.

5. Conflicts can be resolved individually but automatically by former configuration for each template.

6. CobiGen provides an Eclipse integration as well as a Maven Integration.

7. CobiGen comes with an extensive documentation for users and developers.

8. Templates can be fully tailored to project needs - this is considered as a simple task.

Now we will proceed with Cobigen installation.
====

Firstly, we have to clone the cobigen repository.



Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}


If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p cobigenreposetup`{{execute T1}}

`cd  cobigenreposetup`{{execute T1}}


Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen.git`{{execute T1}}
