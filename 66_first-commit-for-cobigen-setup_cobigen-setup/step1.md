Now we have to install devonfw for cobigen setup.





If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p cobigenrepo`{{execute T1}}

`cd  cobigenrepo`{{execute T1}}


Now clone the repository to your local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen.git`{{execute T1}}
