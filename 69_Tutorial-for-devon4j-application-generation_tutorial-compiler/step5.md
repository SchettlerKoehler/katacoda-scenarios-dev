If the parent directories aren't already in the project, 'mkdir -p' will create them for you. 

`mkdir -p /root/tutorials/my-thai-star`{{execute T1}}

Switch to the IDE and click 'Copy to Editor'. 

'index.asciidoc' will be created automatically inside the newly created folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="tutorials/my-thai-star/index.asciidoc">
