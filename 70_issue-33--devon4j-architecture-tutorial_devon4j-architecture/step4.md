In this, we will create sample devon4j application with name sampleapp. 


## Setting up your java project

Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}

Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command.

`devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp`{{execute T1}}

In explorer window near katacoda editor, you can see folder structure like devonfw-&gt; workspaces-&gt; main you should be able to see folder sampleapp. If you will expand this project you will see api, core and server modules generated. All modules follow architectural concept explain previously.
