This step explains Key principles and architecture principles.



### Key Principles

For devonfw we follow these fundamental key principles for all decisions about architecture, design, or choosing standards, libraries, and frameworks:

* *KISS* 
Keep it small and simple
* *Open* 
Commitment to open standards and solutions (no required dependencies to commercial or vendor-specific standards or solutions)
* *Patterns* 
We concentrate on providing patterns, best-practices and examples rather than writing framework code.
* *Solid* 
We pick solutions that are established and have been proven to be solid and robust in real-live (business) projects.

### Architecture Principles
Additionally we define the following principles that our architecture is based on:

* *Component Oriented Design* 
We follow a strictly component oriented design to address the following sub-principles:
*  [Separation of Concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
*  [Reusability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability) and avoiding [redundant code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_code)
*  [Information Hiding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding) via component API and its exchangeable implementation treated as secret.
*  _Design by Contract_ for self-contained, descriptive, and stable component APIs.
*  [Layering](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#technical-architecture) as well as separation of business logic from technical code for better maintenance.
*  _Data Sovereignty_ (and _high cohesion with low coupling_) says that a component is responsible for its data and changes to this data shall only happen via the component. Otherwise, maintenance problems will arise to ensure that data remains consistent. Therefore, interfaces of a component that may be used by other components are designed _call-by-value_ and not _call-by-reference_.
* *Homogeneity* 
Solve similar problems in similar ways and establish a uniform [code-style](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/coding-conventions.asciidoc).

As an architect you should be prepared for the future by reading the [TechnoVision](https://www.capgemini.com/de-de/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/07/TechnoVision-2020-Report.pdf).
