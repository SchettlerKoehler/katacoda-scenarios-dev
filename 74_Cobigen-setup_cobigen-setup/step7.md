    3. Follow the installation wizard
    Select CobiGen Eclipse Plug-in → Next → Next → accept the license → Finish → OK → Yes

    4. Once installed, a new menu entry named &#34;CobiGen&#34; will show up in the Package Explorer’s context menu. In the sub menu there will the Generate​ command, which may ask you to update the templates, and then you can start the generation wizard of CobiGen. You can adapt the templates by clicking on Adapt Templates which will give you the possibility to import the CobiGen_Templates automatically so that you can modified them.

    4. Checkout (clone) your project’s templates folder or use the current templates released with CobiGen (https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/tree/master/cobigen-templates) and then choose Import -&gt; General -&gt; Existing Projects into Workspace to import the templates into your workspace.

    5. Now you can start generating. To get an introduction of CobiGen try the devon4j templates and work on the devon4j sample application. There you might want to start with Entity objects as a selection to run CobiGen with, which will give you a good overview of what CobiGen can be used for right out of the box in devon4j based development. If you need some more introduction in how to come up with your templates and increments, please be referred to the documentation of the context configuration and the templates configuration



After installation we will go through the modes of usage of CobiGen.
