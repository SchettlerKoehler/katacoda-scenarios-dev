Now you have devonIde installed.

 1. Before proceeding with setup. Have a look at feature and characteristics of cobigen.

 2. Generate fresh files across all the layers of a application - ready to run.

3. Add on to existing files merging code into it. E.g. generate new methods into existing java classes or adding nodes to an XML file. Merging of contents into existing files will be done using structural merge mechanisms.
