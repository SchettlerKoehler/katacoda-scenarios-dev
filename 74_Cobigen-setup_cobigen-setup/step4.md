In order to execute the commands we will have to initialize the CobiGen CLI first.



CobiGen CLI is installed inside your devonfw distribution. In order to execute it follow the next steps:

1. Run console.bat, this will open a console.

2. Execute cobigen or cg and the man page should be printed.

3. Use a valid CobiGen input file and run cobigen generate &lt;pathToInputFile&gt;. Note: On the first execution of the CLI, CobiGen will download all the needed dependencies, please be patient.

A list of increments will be printed so that you can start the generation.

# CLI update command
command is &#34;cobigen update&#34;. In which you can select the plugins whichever you want to update.

`cobigen update`{{execute T1}}



In the next step we will learn about troubleshooting and how we can deal with unwanted files.
