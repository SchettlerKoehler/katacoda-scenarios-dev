In order to execute the commands we will have to initialize the CobiGen CLI first.



CobiGen CLI is installed inside your devonfw distribution. In order to execute it follow the next steps:

1. Run console.bat, this will open a console.

2. Execute cobigen or cg and the man page should be printed.

3. Use a valid CobiGen input file and run cobigen generate &lt;pathToInputFile&gt;. Note: On the first execution of the CLI, CobiGen will download all the needed dependencies, please be patient.

A list of increments will be printed so that you can start the generation.

# Examples:
A selection of commands that you can use with the CLI:

1. cobigen generate foo\bar\EmployeeEntity.java: As no output path has been defined, CobiGen will try to find the pom.xml of the current project in order to set the generation root path.

2. cobigen generate foo\bar\*.java --out other\project: Will retrieve all the Java files on that input folder and generate the code on the path specified by --out.

3. cg g foo\bar\webServices.yml --increment TO: Performs a string search using TO and will print the closest increments

4. cg g foo\bar\webServices.yml -i 1,4,6: Directly generates increments with IDs 1, 4 and 6. CobiGen will not request you any other input.

5. cg a: Downloads the latest CobiGen_Templates and unpacks them next to the CLI. CobiGen will from now on use these unpacked Templates for generation.

6. cg a -cl C:\my\custom\location: Downloads the latest CobiGen_Templates and unpacks them in C:\my\custom\location. CobiGen will from now on use these unpacked Templates for generation.

# CLI update command
command is &#34;cobigen update&#34;. In which you can select the plugins whichever you want to update.



In the next step we will learn about troubleshooting and how we can deal with unwanted files.
