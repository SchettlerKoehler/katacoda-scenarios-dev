Once build is successful you will get bootified-war generated in server module target folder. In sampleapp check for path sampleapp/server/sampleapp-server-bootified.war




Now you have to open another terminal. Click on the cd command twice and you will change to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main/devonfw/workspaces/main/sampleapp/server&#39; in terminal 2 automatically. Alternatively you can click on the + next to &#39;IDE&#39;, choose the option &#39;Open New Terminal&#39; and run the cd command afterwards. 


`cd devonfw/workspaces/main/devonfw/workspaces/main/sampleapp/server`{{execute T2}}

Start the server in terminal 2 by running the maven command 'mvn spring-boot:run'.

Because this terminal runs the server we will not use it for any other command.
 

`devon mvn spring-boot:run`{{execute T2 }}

This will take some time.
