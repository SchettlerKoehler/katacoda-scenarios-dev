In single-page-applications as the application size increases its loading speed decreases (since typically the entire application is loaded at once). Lazy loading is a dessign pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed. Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. In this tutorial we will build a simple app to understand how lazyloading is implemented in Angular.

## Prerequisites
* devonfw-ide installed
* Basic Angular knowledge

## Learning goals
In this tutorial we will learn how to:
* create an Angular application using the devon command
* add Angular Material to the application
* import Angular Material components into our modules
* use Material icons in the application
* use a prebulit theme to style the application
* create layout (conataining a header with menu along with a sidenav with navigational links) with the Angular Material components
