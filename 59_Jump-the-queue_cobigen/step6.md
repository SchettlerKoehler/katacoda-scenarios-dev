## CobiGen Java


Start CobiGen CLI and pass the file as parameter by executing the following command.
`devon cobigen generate cobigenexample/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/cobigenexample/customermanagement/dataaccess/api/CustomerEntity.java`{{execute T1}}

CobiGen will ask you which files to generate. You can enter the numbers separated by commas. 
`1,3,5,6,8`{{execute T1}}

CobiGen will now generate code based on the source file and the templates you have passed.
