CobiGen is integrated via plugin in the VS Code IDE. We will use it to generate code from one single java class based on existing templates.


Run the cobiGen command 'adapt-templates' to generate a new templates folder and save its location in a configuration file.

`devon cobigen adapt-templates`{{execute T1}}
