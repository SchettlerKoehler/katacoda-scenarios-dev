Now you need to switch to the folder you just created.

`cd my-thai-star`{{execute T1}}

After that, you can build and run the application using docker-compose. 



Now you have to open another terminal. Click on the cd command twice and you will change to &#39;my-thai-star&#39; in terminal 2 automatically. Alternatively you can click on the + next to &#39;IDE&#39;, choose the option &#39;Open New Terminal&#39; and run the cd command afterwards. 


`cd my-thai-star`{{execute T2}}


Now run docker-compose.
 

`docker-compose up`{{execute T2 }}

This will take some time.


Then you can open the following link to use the app. 
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
