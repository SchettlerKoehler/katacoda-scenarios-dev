CobiGen uses the backend classes for generating your code used in the angular application. So in the next steps you will create a java project, create a simple java class and run the backend server.


## Setting up your java project

Please change the folder to &#39;devonfw/workspaces/main&#39;.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main`{{execute T1}}

Now you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command.

`devon java create com.example.application.backendServer`{{execute T1}}
